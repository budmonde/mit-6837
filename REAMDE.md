# 6.837 Fall 2017 Final Project

Project completed by Budmonde Duinkharjav(budmonde) and Danny Tang(data1013)

## ACTIONABLES

1. Create a particle system to model the behaviour of a water droplet.
2. Create the heightmap data structure so that we can visualize the water droplets.
3. Implement the kinematics of water droplets (the heuristic of how a water droplet moves given its position, velocity, mass and surface affinity) -- ignore interaction between water droplets for now.
4. Implement creation of residual water droplets.
